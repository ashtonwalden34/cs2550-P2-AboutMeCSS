        <h2>My personal interests</h2>

        <p class="essay">
            I enjoy watching and playing basketball with friends. My favorite team is the Los
        Angeles Lakers and my favorite player is LeBron James. I played basketball in high school
        and was even the team captain my senior year. 
        <br> <br>
                I also enjoy reading. I haven't been an avid reader for most of my life, 
            but this year I have made it a goal to read every day. I have really enjoyed this
            experience as it has lead me to research and pick up books this year that I never
            would have in the past.
        <br> <br>
                I was originally a Mechanical Engineering major before I switched to computer science.
            I even did an internship with a company called Mixtec North America. I worked on 3D modeling of 
            industrial mixers and was the manager over spare parts. I really enjoyed this and this was my first
            exposure to coding as well. We had a program that would build 3D models of the impeller blades for
            each mixer and I helped code part of that.
